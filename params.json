It allows you the flexibility of booting installations without having to go track down and download installation media.  It's especially useful for remote access environments when you don't want to utilize remote attach CD in a Dell DRAC, HP iLO or some other type of remote tool.  It's especially awesome for bootstrapping your own custom installation on a Cloud Server!\r\n\r\nCheck out the new boot.rackspace.com documentation hosted at ReadTheDocs:\t\r\n* [http://bootrackspacecom.readthedocs.org/en/latest/](http://bootrackspacecom.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)\r\n\r\n#### Feedback\r\n\r\nFeel free to open up an issue on github or contact us via <bootrax@rackspace.com>.\r\n","google":"UA-68807-12","note":"Don't delete this file!
